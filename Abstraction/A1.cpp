// üß™ Practice Problem: Employee Payment System

// üìù Problem Statement:
// Design an abstract base class called Employee with a pure virtual function calculateSalary(). Then create two derived classes:
// FullTimeEmployee (with basicSalary)
// PartTimeEmployee (with hoursWorked and hourlyRate)
// Each derived class should override the calculateSalary() function to display the salary based on its logic.

// üîß Requirements:
// Use a base class pointer to access derived class methods.
// Demonstrate abstraction by hiding the salary calculation logic behind a common interface.

#include<string>

//ABSTRACT CLASS 
class Employee{
    public:
    virtual void calculateSalary() = 0;

    void calculateSalary(){
        cout<<"with hoursWorked and hourlyRate"<<endl;
    }

    PartTimeEmployee p;
    p.calculateSalary();
